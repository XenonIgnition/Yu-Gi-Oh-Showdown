# Yu-Gi-Oh-Showdown
A showdown-esque website similar to Pokemon Showdown where multiple variations of Yu-Gi-Oh formats will be available to play.

<h1> Yu-Gi-Oh Showdown </h1>
<p> This is an attempt at reviving one of the most revolutionary card games that spawned many of the card games that we see nowadays. </p>
<p> However, I wanted to take a different direction and implement a format and leaderboard similar to how Pokemon Showdown operates; hence the name. </p>
<p> Taking that concept, users should be able to play in their most beloved format before they ended up leaving their cards in their deck never to be touched again. </p>
<p> This is different to how dueling-book.net works in that they will always take recency into account and utilize the latest format both traditional and advanced." </p>
<p> This approach should help to provide more to the general yu-gi-oh fan. </p>
<p> We also include a ladder system for competitive play in each format, howeever, we may consider implementing a division system later if the user database expands </p>

<h2> Current State </h2>
<p> Now in a wip </p>
